# Transaction Response

The response from the transaciton endpoint tells the client what it needs to do next, including if it needs to <Link to="/interaction">interact with the user</Link> and any <Link to="/tokens">tokens that have been issued</Link>. 

If the transaction can be continued by the client, the AS includes a transaction handle in the response as well. This handle is used by the client for any subsequent references to this transaciton. 

The response can also include handles that the client can use in future transactions in lieu of any of the request sections.
