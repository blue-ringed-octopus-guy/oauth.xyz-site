# Description

Highly distributed systems don't want to pay the overhead of client registration.

# Why OAuth doesn't work

OAuth requires that all clients are registered and have a client_id known to the AS.

# What OAuth extensions are doing

Dynamic client registration allows clients to get a client ID.

The client ID can be packed with information about the client itself, allowing "Stateless" clients.

# How XYZ solves it

XYZ allows a client to simply state everything about itself in the context of the transaction request, which can be enough for an end-user to make the appropriate security decision. Instead of having to register a client object just to attach an access token and rights to it, XYZ creates a transaction record which more naturally maps to the final artifacts of the authorization request.
