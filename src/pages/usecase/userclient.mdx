# Description

The user has a mobile client application that has already been onboarded and provisioned with a set of verifiable claims about the user. This application then needs to get access on that user's behalf to a set of web APIs.

Normally, the AS can determine what needs to be done based on the claims, but sometimes will need to 

# Why OAuth doesn't work

The client has no standard way of pushing information about the user to the server. Since interactions start through the browser, any sensitive information about the user would need to be protected and encrypted. Since OAuth requires client registration to put keys to the server, we would need DynReg to manage a mobile application.

# What OAuth extensions are doing

You could manage to finagle this with the token exchange protocol, but that falls apart when you need interaction.

# How XYZ solves it

The client pushes claims about the user in the transaction request. The AS determines from the request if interaction is required or not, and tells the client to send the user there if necessary, or issues a token otherwise.
