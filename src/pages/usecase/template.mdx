# What OAuth extensions are doing


# How XYZ solves it




Anything to do with Push:
  - servers push to clients
  - AS push to RS
  - AS push to users

Lisa Levasher
  - me2b alliance
  - more rational version of VRM stuff
  - wrote a paper w/eve on decentralized ID for IEEE
    - "consent is broken"
    - 'right to use' licensing
    - you have to template what the instructions are or everyone won't go for it
    - now you need mechanisms to carry that (intent registration)
  
Use cases
  - being put into GitHub

UMA2 is more fragile
  - Identos (for example) to talk about their extensions but in private
